' Testing Motion for Production App

' LOGIC: Evaluate Alignment and General Performance by:
'  - Increase speed and ramp aggression with repeated full motion and short motion tests on each axis
'     in order to produce stalls. Hopefully, stalling happens above the target max speeds.


' About to begin testing. Zeroing the tool first. OK?
